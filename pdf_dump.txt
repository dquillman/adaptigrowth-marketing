🎓  Anti-Gravity AI Certification Coach: Comprehensive
Development Plan
I. Project Goals and Monetization Strategy
App Focus: Adaptive learning platform for high-stakes professional
certification exams (e.g., PMP, CompTIA, CFA Level 1).
Core Value Proposition: Guarantee the most efficient study path by using
AI to identify and relentlessly test the user's weakest topics via a Spaced
Repetition Algorithm.
Monetization Model: Freemium with Tiered Subscription and Annual
Discount (best for fixed-duration study).

II. Legal and Risk Mitigation Strategy (Low-Risk Profile)
The primary goal is to mitigate claims of negligence, intellectual property (IP)
infringement, and failure to guarantee results.
Mandatory Educational Disclaimer:
No Guarantee: Must explicitly state that use of the app does not
guarantee exam success or licensure.
Not Professional Advice: State clearly that the app is for educational
purposes only and is not a substitute for professional, legal, medical, or
financial advice.
Intellectual Property (IP) Compliance:
Question Originality: All practice questions must be original
educational material and not copies of actual exam questions (which is
often copyrighted).
Trademark Use: Use exam trademarks (e.g., "PMP®," "CompTIA®")
as adjectives in small font only. Include a mandatory footnote/disclaimer

stating that your app is not affiliated with, endorsed, or sponsored
by the exam owner/regulator.
Data Protection: Implement standard security protocols (encryption, strong
authentication) to protect user study history and PII. (Note: Unlike the fitness
app, this data is generally not subject to HIPAA or FERPA unless selling to
schools, keeping the risk low).
Insurance: Obtain Technology Errors & Omissions (E&O) Insurance to
cover legal expenses and settlements from claims of negligence or mistakes
in the service (e.g., a buggy answer key).
III. Technical Architecture (Same as Fitness App)
Single Firebase Project: Shared services for efficiency.
Site 1 (Primary): Certification Coach App (User-Facing) on Firebase
Hosting.
Site 2 (Secondary): Admin/CMS App for Question Bank Management on
Firebase Hosting.
Backend: Cloud Functions (Node.js/Python) for the Adaptive Question
Selector.
Database: Cloud Firestore stores Mastery Scores and the Question
Bank.

V. Core AI Logic: Adaptive Question Selector (getAdaptiveQuestions)
Goal: Maximize learning efficiency by scheduling the hardest topics for
review just before the user forgets them.
Core Algorithm: Spaced Repetition (custom SM-2 model).
Input Data: User's Mastery Score (M), Confidence Score, and Recency of
Review (Interval Factor - IF).
Process: The function uses the IF to prioritize topics flagged as High
Urgency (M is low or user got it wrong recently) and then selects  of
the quiz questions from those high-urgency pools.
With this detailed plan, you are ready to build a high-value, defensible educational
app.
