USER DATA:
- Total questions: ${total}
- Correct answers: ${correct}
- Accuracy percentage: ${percent}%
- Weakest domain: ${weakest_domain}
- Thinking traps: ${trapsText}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Write in clear sections with short headers.
- Use friendly but professional language.
- Be honest without being harsh.
- Sound like a real coach talking to one person.
- Under 250 words.
- Do not mention templates, prompts, stats tables, or internal logic.
- Do not save or reference past attempts.
- Do not repeat raw numbers unless they add meaning.
- Do not use bullet overload — this appears in a modal.

REQUIRED STRUCTURE (USE THESE HEADERS):

Overall Read
Open with an honest assessment. If strong, acknowledge without hype. If weaker, normalize it as useful signal, not failure.

Where You Lost Ground
Name the weakest domain. Explain what PMI tests there: People means servant leadership, conflict, influence. Process means choosing the right framework. Business Environment means linking decisions to value and strategy. Warn about the most common mistake in that domain.

Pattern to Watch
If thinking traps are present, call out the pattern and explain how PMI exploits it. If empty, infer a likely mistake from the weakest domain. Focus on thinking errors, not knowledge gaps.

One Thing to Do Next
Give exactly ONE concrete, immediately usable action. No lists.

Final Word
One sentence of grounded encouragement. No cliches, no hype.

TONE: Calm. Direct. Supportive. Confident. No marketing language. No cheerleading.`;
