🙏 Thank you — ExamCoach v1.15.0 is live (trial extended)



Message:

Hi , thank you for testing ExamCoach.



Your feedback during testing directly shaped v1.15.0, which went live last night. Several usability fixes and flow improvements came straight from tester input — so yes, it mattered.



What’s new in this release:

1. A clearer Start Here experience so users know exactly what to do next
2. Improved diagnostics and explanations focused on exam-style reasoning
3. A cleaner, less distracting dashboard
4. Password reset is now available directly in the login
5. Added FAQ page

&nbsp;	

We’ve also extended your access with another full 14-day trial — full features, no limits.



Please keep the feedback coming. You can use “Report a Problem” in the app header at any time. Every issue submitted is documented, reviewed, and triaged for a fix. We actively monitor and act on these reports.



One more thing — ExamCoach is designed to support multiple professional exams, not just one.

If you could recommend the next exam EC should support, which would it be?

Thanks again for helping shape ExamCoach.
