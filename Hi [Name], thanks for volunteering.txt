Hi [Name], thanks for volunteering — I appreciate it.

Here’s how to get started:

🔗 App: https://examcoachpro.ai

Sign up with the email you want tied to your trial.

⏱ Trial: You’ll get a 14-day full-access trial (nothing limited). Once I see your signup, I’ll activate it.

🎯 What I’m looking for:
I want blunt, practical feedback, especially:

What’s confusing or unclear

What feels like a waste of time

What actually helps you understand why an answer is right or wrong

Even 10–15 minutes of real use is enough to be valuable.

🐞 Reporting issues:
Inside the app, use “Report a Problem” anytime something feels broken, unclear, or frustrating. Short notes are perfect.

This isn’t salesy — you’re helping shape a serious exam prep tool for real candidates. I genuinely want your input, and I want this to help you succeed on the exam.

Thanks again — I’m looking forward to your feedback and wishing you success with your exam prep.

— Dave
