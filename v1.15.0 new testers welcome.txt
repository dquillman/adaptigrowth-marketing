Invitation to test ExamCoach (full access)

Message:
Hi — thanks for connecting.

We’re inviting a small group of new testers to try ExamCoach (EC), a focused training system designed to prepare professionals for certification exams using realistic, exam-style scenarios — not trivia quizzes.

What we’re asking testers to do:
• Use the app naturally as part of their study
• Try the diagnostic and guided study flow
• Share feedback using the “Report a Problem” link in the app header

What you’ll get:
• Full access with a 14-day tester trial
• A direct voice in shaping the product
• Early access as new professional exams are added

Every issue reported is documented and triaged — this is active development, not a survey.

If you’re open to testing, you can start here:
👉 https://examcoachpro.ai

If you decide it’s not for you, no pressure — but if you are studying or restarting, we think you’ll find EC refreshingly different.
